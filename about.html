        <h2>About the exhibit</h2>
        <img src="images/first.jpg" />
        <p><em>Perpetua(l)</em> came about during the closing days of the iconic webcam portal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020605224823/http://camwhores.com/">CamWhores.com</a>. While reviewing 17,000 photos that comprised my image archive, 200 or so cell phone cam photos stood out as snapshots of mobile history. </p>
        <p>To the best of my knowledge, in 2004 no one had yet implemented the process of taking a photo with a mobile phone and sending it to a webcam or gallery within a social network, over a cellular data connection. The first "camera phone" had been released only a year or so prior.
        </p>
        <p>As these camera phones gained traction, I saw an opportunity to untether myself from the webcam cord. I <a href="images/forum.png">picked up a flip phone</a> to carry along with my Windows Mobile phone. Crucially, it had a good camera for the time.</p>
        <p><img src="images/firstselfie.jpg" />Browsing through hundreds of snapshots, one particular photo leapt out at me. receipt.jpg. I knew that shot. I had Instagrammed one with the same subject and composition months ago. I pulled them up side by side. Ten years apart, they were different but the visual communication is strikingly similar.</p>
        <p>Curated here are pairings of photos to illustrate commonalities and to highlight where we have changed (e.g. the invention of the hashtag) in mobile photography over the past decade.
        </p>

        <h2>About the artist</h2>

        <p>As 'StephTheGeek' since 2000 when I was assigned the moniker by my high school classmates, I have witnessed the art & play of the webcam evolve from intermittent 320x240px images to a diverse empire of HD streaming video websites——both tame & titilating. While it was perhaps difficult to predict at the time that selfies would become such a defining aspect of internet culture, I was no stranger to the marketing appeal, and first created a public webcam in order to raise funds to record my album (released in 2003).</p>
        <img src="images/glasses-2019.jpg" style="float:left;margin:30px;margin-left:0;width:50%;" />
        <p>My graduate studies at UC Berkeley were motivated by a drive to comprehend the world of radical personal transparency I had thrown myself into. During the mid-2000s, I broadcast myself on 24/7 webcams, published a live stream of my web browsing activity, and dabbled in pre-Foursquare era location sharing.</p>

        <p>In exploring a lifestreamed, quantified view of the digital self, I unapologetically blend art & raw artist. Sexuality, science, collective consciousness, mental health, and unabashed positivity mixed with dark humor permeate my eclectic world.</p>

        <p>The medium is the message——and so is the journey. I am a strong proponent of "showing your work" along the way of this messy expedition that is being human!</p>
